# barleypheno
An R package for processing and manipulating raw phenotype data typically generated in the University of Minnesota Barley Breeding Group. Functions allow for a reproducible pipeline for different end goals, including genomic prediction, spatial adjustment, or database upload (i.e. T3).

## Introduction
In our breeding program, we generate raw phenotype data that requires multiple
processing steps. Like in many data stewardship pipelines, we visualize our raw
data, check for outliers, process and compile it, correct for spatial variability,
then store it long-term on home drives or in a database. This package provides
functions and a pipeline for accurately and rapidly processing raw data for many
different end uses.

## Installation

Install the developmental version from GitHub via the `devtools` package:
```
devtools::install_github("neyhartj/NAME")
